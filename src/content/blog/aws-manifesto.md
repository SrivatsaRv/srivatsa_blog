This document is more than a roadmap. I write this at a time where I can say my AWS production experience has just started. It's a long way to go. This is my post to commit to the journey.

I have the foundational knowledge. I know infrastructure. I understand the cloud. But now, it's time to operate at a new level: **automation-first**, thinking from software first principles while being architecture-aware.

This manifesto will:
- Anchor me in a clear direction
- Eliminate distractions
- Maintain momentum
- Turn intention into action

## Core Beliefs

> Time is scarce. Waste is a luxury, every hour matters.

1. **Learning AWS is not a checkbox, it's a force multiplier.**
2. **Every AWS service I learn has a place in a system.**
3. **Mastery begins with structure.**
4. **Speed matters. But clarity wins.**

## My Pledge

I will:
- Dedicate focused blocks of study weekly (minimum of 1 hour/day).
- Apply every new concept in a hands-on lab or case-study.
- Avoid watching or reading passively—I will build.
- Set milestone reviews every Sunday night.
- Treat this not as an exam but as a skill upgrade for life.

## Operational Reminders

**"Capability to carry out the intended setup triumphs theoretical knowledge."**

**"The goal is to be the master systems one at a time, until the 10k feet view is achieved."**

**"Think like a software engineer, opiniate like an architect."**

## Conclusion

When I master AWS, I will:
- Design better.
- Automate more confidently.
- Own what I deploy.
- Contribute to infra that scales fearlessly.
- Be ready for architecture, audit, failure, and success.
